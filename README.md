# Matthew Levinson
**AI Safety Researcher | Mechanistic Interpretability and Alignment**

I bring deep technical expertise from computational biology, large-scale ML systems, and advanced statistical modeling to mechanistic interpretability research. I am currently focused on understanding how neural networks represent and process information with an eye towards alignment and ensuring the future of humanity.


***Recent Work***<br>
My recent work has explored [information storage versus annotated latent computation](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=svMpLjlExR) in a thinking model's chain of thought, [describing activation distributions](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rzpKYr7xYwHgsccLA/beyond-gaussian-language-model-representations-and) in decoder-only transformers, and investigating [classification through activation distributions](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6PCjTM55jdYBgHNyp/activation-magnitudes-matter-on-their-own-insights-from-1). The repo for the chain of thought work is under my research partner's account [here](https://github.com/immindich/neel-mats-sprint). Note that code was born during a crazy sprint and has never been cleaned up!

***Current Research***<br>
I am currently working on unsupervised methods for discovering cases where models are using belief states internally to keep track of evidence in a given state space or abstract classification. I also have ongoing work in two other areas. I'm working on jointly training SAEs and Meta SAEs, pushing SAE optimization towards latents representing more fundamental concepts that are not easily decomposable into combinations of other latents. I also have a fairly mature project on a new formulation for circuit discovery informed by Bayesian modeling in the beta-copula-circuits repo below. I am particularly interested in developing this towards unsupervised network decomposition to broadly characterize drivers of critical computation. Reach out if you're interested in collaborating.
